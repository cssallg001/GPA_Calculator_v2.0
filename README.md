# GPA_Calculator_v2.0

The second version of a GPA calculator that I wrote for fun and because I really liked the thought of having the convenience of having a gpa calculator on my local machine rather than relying on a calculator on a webpage. 
I first wanted to make sure the logic of my code worked first. Don't know when per se, but I know I'll eventually get around to the To Do list below.

To do:
• Interactive GUI
• Further Bug Testing/Fixing
• Clean-up/optimize code?

I don't mind if anyone wants to use this code for their own purposes, but if you want to publish your work with this code please make sure to give credit.
I'm merely a Computer Science student, so I am open to all forms of constructive feedback and criticism.
