# GPA_Calculator_v2.0

The second version of a GPA calculator that I wrote for fun and because I really liked the thought of having the convenience of having a gpa calculator on my local machine rather than relying on a calculator on a webpage. 
I first wanted to make sure the logic of my code worked first. Don't know when per se, but I know I'll eventually get around to the To Do list below.

To do:
• Interactive GUI
• Further Bug Testing/Fixing
• Clean-up/optimize code?

I'm merely a Computer Science student so I know my code isn't as perfect or efficient as it could be, however, I am open to all forms of constructive feedback and criticism.
