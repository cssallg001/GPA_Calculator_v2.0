# GPA Calculator v2.0

GPA Calculator v2.0  
By Sean Allgaier

A GPA calculator that I wrote for fun and because I really liked the thought of having the convenience of having a gpa calculator on my local machine rather than relying on a calculator on a webpage. 
I first wanted to make sure the logic of my code worked first. I'll eventually get around to the To Do list below, though I'm not sure when per se.

To do:  
• Interactive GUI  
• Further Bug Testing/Fixing?  
• Clean-up/optimize code?  

I'm merely a Computer Science student so I know my code isn't as perfect or efficient as it could be, however, I am open to all forms of constructive feedback and criticism.
