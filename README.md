# GPA Calculator v2.0

GPA Calculator v2.0  
By Sean Allgaier

A GPA calculator that I wrote for fun and because I really liked the thought of having the convenience of having a gpa calculator on my local machine rather than relying on a calculator on a webpage. 
Titled as v2.0 because this is my second attempt at making a tool for calculating GPAs, however, each version will be titled appropriately when I eventually get around to making official releases. 


I'll eventually get around to the To Do list below, though I'm not sure when per se.

To do:  
• Interactive GUI  
• Make official release  
• Further Bug Testing/Fixing?  
• Clean-up/optimize code?  

I'm merely a Computer Science student so I know my code isn't as perfect or efficient as it could be, however, I am open to all forms of constructive feedback and criticism.
